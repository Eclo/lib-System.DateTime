### Welcome to the **nanoFramework** System.DateTime Library repository!

[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/nanoFramework.System.DateTime.svg)]() [![#yourfirstpr](https://img.shields.io/badge/first--timers--only-friendly-blue.svg)](https://github.com/nanoframework/Home/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

This is a subset of the base class library were the `System.DateTime` lives in the full .NET framework.

It's provided as a separate assembly to decrease the overall size of mscorlib (making it more suitable for devices with less flash space).

**Note**: for this namespace to be available in the firmware image it has to be build with the option `API_System.DateTime` set to `ON`.
